# The Iron Yard Crash Course

## Intro to HTML and CSS

These are the materials for a crash course in HTML and CSS delivered by The Iron Yard! Feel free to use these materials in any way you wish so long as it is _not for commercial use_.

### How do I use this code?

1. To start, click on the "Clone or download" button on GitHub (it's green, on the right side of the page).
  * This will allow you to download a zip file with all this stuff in it.
1. Unzip the file somewhere on your computer.
1. Open up that directory using a code editor like Atom or Sublime Text.
1. You can review the finished code (in the `finished` directory) or start to work on your own solution!
  * To start your own solution, create two new files: `index.html` and `styles.css`
  * Start putting your HTML code in the `index.html` file.
  * Add your presentation pieces (CSS code) in the `styles.css` file.
1. When you're done, you can create an account on github.com and upload your files there!
  * If you name the repository `[your-user-name].github.io` then you will be able to see your creation live on the Internet!
  * (_Note: replace your actual GitHub username above!_)
